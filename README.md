## Objective ##
This project was created at SigmaHacks 2.0 with a team of 3 developers. Refillr is an automation platform targeted for legal professionals. 
It allows the user to automate the process of document and form completetions. This project enables the user to use UiPath technology to easily 
fill in the paperwork without repeating steps. This allows for the user to provide the necessary information to the platform which then automates 
the completion of the required document. The document is then directly sent to the lawyer judge.

## Document Automation ##
In many scenarios, the associated associated is standard and the paperwork that follows can be easily automated by two parties that mutually agree 
upon the conditions. The automation for the document can be the names of the parties involved, date of birth, address, etc.

This platform uses various resources which are used to input information on the website which is then stored. 
This stored information is then used by UiPath to compile and finalize the forms in Word Format. 
In the creation of the website, we referred to online CSS files as well that provided support to better customize the documents. 
The process of creating the website was taken in stages, as we created the UX design to outline the proper formation of the product, 
followed by the appropriate code to follow. The languages involved in the creation of the website were CSS/HTML and Python in a Flask framework. 
In regards to the UiPath, the final objective was to create a form that captures text and processes the data to replace the documentation. This enables the 
admin to monitor the data that is apprehended by the software and easily automate the information.
